This repository includes various dynamic visualizations that were implemented in the mito browser. As the mito browser was implemented in a React environment, this project uses React as well.

## Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which is required for create-react-app
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which can be installed with the command: `npm install create-react-app`
- The app also uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), which can be installed with `npm install react-router-dom`

## Getting Started

A React app can be created with `npx create-react-app mito_browser`.

In the project directory, start the app in development mode using `npm start`.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
